<h4>CHAPTER FIVE(5)</h4>
 <h5><em>Steps to develop a class</em></h5>
    <p>
    <li>
        <il>Figure out what the class is suppose to do</il> 
        <il>List the instance variables and methods</il>
        <il>Write a prepcode for the methods </il>
        <il>Write test code for the methods</il>
        <il>Implement the class</il>
        <il>Test the methods</il>
        <il>Debug and reimplement as appropriate</il>
    </li>
    <br>
        Choose for loop over while loop for a more comprehensive method.
    </p>

<h4>CHAPTER SEVEN(7)</h4>
<p>
Inheritance allow classes to share methods and sometimes other classes. <br>
We use inheritance to emphasize on specifics the the subclasses possess that the parent doesn't.
 <br>
The Datatype must be suitable and have the same arguements for an override <strong>whilest</strong> the arguement and return type can be different in an overload.
</p>

<h4>CHAPTER EIGHT(8)<h4>
<p>
The words Abstract in java doesn't make a class a parent class. A class can be a parent class with the <strong>"Abstract" </strong>keyword, rather the <strong>"Abstract" </strong>keyword prevents the class from being instantiated. <br>
Thus; prevent an object from being made out of them.
</p>

<h4>CHAPTER TEN(10)</h4>
<p>
The keyword <strong>"static" </strong>lets the method runs <em> without any instance of the class</em>. Thus, the behaviour is not dependent on an instance variable. <br>
 Use Math.min(5,6); to call a static method. <br>
Where Math is the class name
